"""
	This is written by Zhiyang Ong to convert a list of names for the "Author" or "Editor" fields in BibTeX into the proper letter case.

	A number of publications, such as those from the National Academies Press, tend to list the names of authors in upper case (or capitals). Hence, we need to fix the letter case for these names before entering them into a reference management software or databases of references, such as BibTeX databases.




#### TO BE FIXED
	This script does not work for the following string of names.

	Use a character space as the delimiter between entities in the list of names.

	Names of different co-authors are separated by " and ".

	Names of each (co-)author, such as their first/given name, family/surname, or middle name, are separated by a character space.

	There are (co-)authors with compound surnames, such as double/double-barrelled/hyphenated/triple-barrelled surnames, or some other compound surname (such as those that contain nobiliary particles to reflect the nobility of their family or family name affixes).

	There are (co-)authors with compound given names.

	Also, there are (co-)authors that have their names written only in lower case.

	The names are statistically not going to be in all lower case.
	For a significant number of times, they appear in all upper case.

	Skip checking if the list of names is all in upper case before proceeding.

	This is because I use " and " to connect full names together, and to distinguish a full name, or personal name, from another.
	Hence, the list of names would never be all in upper case.

		first character/letter, and I need to make it lower case later.
