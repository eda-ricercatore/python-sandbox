"""
	This is written by Zhiyang Ong to test operations to get timestamps
		and date-timestamps.



	Synopsis: command name and [argument(s)]
	./test_time_operations.py

	

	


	Notes/Assumptions:
	Since I would be categorizing and storing the experimental results
		based on the year and month, the filename containg experimental
		results would be named in the DD-MM-YY-HH-MM-SS-uS format so that
		I can quickly find the file of a given build (or experimental
		run) as I read the filename from left to right.

	Unix time (also known as Epoch time,[1][2][3] POSIX time,[4] seconds since the Epoch,[5] or UNIX Epoch time[6]) is a system for describing a point in time.

	Hence, using the time.time() method to obtain the timestamp will
		provide the timestamp in UTC time zone.
	
	Hence, use time.time() to record the timestamp in UTC time zone,
		and avoid confusion between time zones on projects with
		geographically distributed contributors/collaborators.
