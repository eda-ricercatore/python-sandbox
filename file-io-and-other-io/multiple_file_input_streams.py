"""
	This Python script is written by Zhiyang Ong to experiment with
		file read operations.


	Synopsis:
	Automatically test file read operations for multiple file streams.

	This script can be executed as follows:
	./multiple_file_input_streams.py





	Notes:
	+ The default mode for the open() method to open file input/output
		streams is the "read" mode [Brandl2017a, in \S7 Input and Output: \S 7.2. Reading and Writing Files].
