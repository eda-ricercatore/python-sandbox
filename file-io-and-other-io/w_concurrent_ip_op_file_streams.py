"""
	This Python script is written by Zhiyang Ong to experiment with
		concurrent input and output file streams.


	Synopsis:
	Automatically test file read and write operations for concurrent
		input and output file streams.

	This script can be executed as follows:
	./w_concurrent_ip_op_file_streams.py



	Notes:
	+ The default mode for the open() method to open file input/output
		streams is the "read" mode [Brandl2017a, in Section 7 Input and Output: Section 7.2. Reading and Writing Files].
